**Swerve drive code was heavily inspired by team 364's swerve drive code for falcon motors, with some modifications for our purposes.

# 1218 Code 2023 </br>

**Basic Swerve Code for a Swerve Module using Falcon Motors, a CTRE CANCoder, and a CTRE Pigeon Gyro** </br>
    This was an off-season code that was created during the fall of 2023. Major improvements from the season include 
    the introduction of command-based architecture and PathPlanner for autonomous sequences. 

This code is natively set up to use a Xbox controller to control the swerve drive. </br>
